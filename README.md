####Company Showcases: Grow, PluralSight, LucidSoftware, Overstock
The idea behind this repo is to give students a concrete goal to strive towards. Multiple studies have shown that if you have a concrete, visualized goal, it is much easier to maintain motivation. A vague goal of "get a job" is not highly motivating to most students. Ergo, the idea is to show students specific, and cool, companies that they can work for after they graduate. Many of these companies have the added bonus of currently employing DevMountain grads. This furthers motivates students by showing them that DevMountain grads do get jobs after they graduate.

####NOTE: THESE SLIDES ARE SMALL AND ONLY CONTAIN MAIN POINTS. PLEASE DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH BEFOREHAND SO YOU CAN ELABORATE WHEN PRESENTING THESE. I FREQUENTLY GO TO THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND SHOW STUDENTS WHAT THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE, OR SHOW THEM AN ACTUAL JOB DESCRIPTION FROM THE COMPANY. GLASSDOOR IS ALSO USEFUL FOR GETTING A GENERAL FEEL FOR THE COMPANY.
